####Overview

Contains the scripts for software and design and layout of the hardware associated with the Schulze et al. eLife 2015 manuscript. The repository is organised into five modules corresponding to the specific tools described in the manuscript. Below is a brief description of each module:

1. Electrophysiolgy: Contains scripts associated with the electrophysiology protocols used in the paper.
2. Spike Sorting (OpSIN): Contains scripts and examples associated with the optogenetics-based spike sorting of the electrophysiology data.
3. Tracker Hardware: Contains design files (CAD format) and inventory for the hardware associated with the high-resolution larval tracker.
4. Wormsign: Contains C++ scripts for the software to conduct experiments at the high-resolution larval tracker.
5. Venkman: Independent software module which is used to define the spatial and temporal virtual olfactory environments tested at the larval tracker. This module is coupled to the Wormsign module.
